# Pocket Farm

This app demonstrates a farming game akin to Pokemon Go. 

Using the drawer you can access the menu. In the world map you click on nearby seeds to collect them. Then you can plant and harvest those seeds in the farm screen by clicking on farm plots. Once that's done, you can go to the shop to sell the harvest, and buy new items and upgrades, using the basket button to view your cart and checking out with the shopping cart button. It's also possible to view your inventory, along with highscore data pertaining to your most grown crops. Data can be saved and loaded when you're on the farm screen using the UI buttons at the top of the screen.
