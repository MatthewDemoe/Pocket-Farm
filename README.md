# Pocket Farm

This app demonstrates a farming game akin to Pokemon Go. 

In the world map you click on nearby seeds to collect them. Then you can plant and harvest those seeds in the farm screen. Once that's done, you can go to the shop to sell the harvest, and buy new items and upgrades. It's also possible to view your inventory, along with data pertaining to your crops.
